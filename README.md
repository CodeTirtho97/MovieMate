MovieMate is a Movie Recommendation System that leverages machine learning techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations. It incorporates both **content-based** and **collaborative filtering** approaches, allowing users to discover movies based on their tastes and preferences.

## Project Overview
The goal of MovieMate is to enhance the movie-watching experience by helping users find films that align with their preferences. This project utilizes the MovieLens dataset to build user and movie profiles, and it offers recommendations using genre-based content filtering and user-based collaborative filtering.

## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the genres that a user likes.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Suggests movies by finding similar users and recommending movies they liked.
- **Hybrid Recommendation** (Future Scope): Combining content-based and collaborative methods for more robust recommendations.

## Datasets
The project uses the **MovieLens 100K dataset**, which includes:
- **Movies**: 1,682 movies with genre tags.
- **Ratings**: 100,000 ratings by 943 users for various movies.

You can download the dataset from [MovieLens 100K](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/).

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for building the recommendation engine.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning algorithms for similarity calculations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and code hosting.

## Usage
### 1. Content-Based Recommendations:
    Based on genres, a userâ€™s preference profile is built. The system recommends movies matching the userâ€™s favorite genres.
### 2. Collaborative Filtering Recommendations:
    Based on similar users, the system recommends movies that users with similar taste have liked.
   
## Running the Project
  Content-Based Filtering:
      You can run the content-based filtering in Content_Based_Filtering.ipynb.
  Collaborative Filtering:
      Open and execute Collaborative_Filtering.ipynb for collaborative recommendations.

## Future Scope
  This project has the potential to expand with more advanced features:

<b>1. Hybrid Recommendation System:</b> Combine content-based and collaborative filtering to create a more accurate recommendation system.

<b>2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering:</b> Use similarity between movies to recommend movies similar to those a user has liked.

<b>3. Real-Time Recommendations:</b> Integrate streaming data for real-time recommendations, updating recommendations as users interact.

<b>4. Sentiment Analysis on Reviews:</b> Incorporate user reviews and apply sentiment analysis to enhance recommendations.

<b>5. UI Development:</b> Create a web-based user interface using Flask or Streamlit for better interaction.

<b>6. Advanced Deep Learning Models:</b> Experiment with deep learning models (e.g., Autoencoders, Neural Collaborative Filtering) for improved recommendation quality.

<b>7. A/B Testing:</b> Implement A/B testing for continuous improvement and better evaluation of recommendation quality.
